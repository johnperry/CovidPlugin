			The Quantitative Imaging for COVID-19 project (QIC) is assembling a free, open-source repository of de-identified
			COVID-19-related imaging data for research and education. Medical institutions interested in joining this international
			collaboration are invited to submit de-identified imaging data for inclusion in the repository. 

			The CovidClient program is a free, open-source tool for collecting and de-identifying DICOM studies to prepare them for
			submission. It may be used to ensure privacy by removing protected health information from your DICOM imaging studies.
